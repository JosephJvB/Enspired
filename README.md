# Art for Art's Sake

Staying at a beach with family for the Christmas of 2017, I got an idea from the shores of Orere Point that I should build a ripple-pool wep-app. The result is pretty far from the initial concept but I had a blast making it and I've been playing with as a user it for a good few hours. Enjoy!

### INSTRUCTIONS:

LEFT palette:
Colour palette controls the fill of the circles.
control the opacity with the + and - buttons.
off button toggles colour fill on and off.
Undo deletes the last saved circle set, can be used multiple times.
DOUBLE CLICK left off button to reset background colour.

RIGHT palette:
Colour palette controls the outline of the circles.
control the size of the circles with the + and - buttons.
off button toggles outline on and off.
clear removes all saved circles.
DOUBLE CLICK right off button for a surprise! Not recommended until you are finished with your picture ;)

DOUBLE CLICK ANY COLOUR TO CHANGE THE BACKGROUND TO THAT COLOUR.

This project uses webpack to transpile and bundle ES6 React code. To use, consider these steps:


Fork this repo Rename your repo according to the app you're building



* `git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git`
* `cd [your-app] && npm install`



To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run npm run dev. The assets built by webpack are placed in server/public. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with: npm run dev

Additional components should be placed in client/components.
